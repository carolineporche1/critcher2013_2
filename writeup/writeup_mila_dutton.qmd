## Introduction

This paper examines how the speed in making moral decisions can shape how others view as, as well as how we assess our own actions.This is a topic that has always been fascinating to me, especially as a psychology undergrad major, with experience researching cognition. The intersection between decision making and moral cognition touches on the core psychological questions regarding ethics, thought process, and social environments.

The experiment will follow the structure of the original study by having participants read stories regarding making moral decisions at varying speeds. In experiment 1, two men find separate wallets in a parking lot. One man immediately decides what to do with the wallet while the other decides after a "long and careful deliberation". In the moral condition, both men turn the wallet in, and in the immoral decision both men keep the wallet. Participants are then given questionnaires in which they rank the following sets: quickness, moral character evaluation, certainty, and emotional impulsivity. Experiment 2 follows a similar structure but is between subjects. The story depicts a single mother who is struggling to afford her son. Her boss offers to adopt her son and in return will triple her salary. She is described as either taking 3 seconds or 3 days to come to a decision, and her decision was independently varied. Participants will then use the same scales as well as two additional scales in which they rank her motives to "get more money" and "protect her child". In our study, we will only be replicating experiment 1. A two way ANOVA test was run to assess decision speed and type of decision, and a regression analysis was run to further explore relationships between certainty and morality.

A potential challenge will be the choice of wording. I was not able to find access to their actual stories, or the questionnaires given to participants. In these types of studies choices in wording, grammar, and tone can have a large impact on participant reaction. In order to be a sufficient replication, it is crucial to have minimal variance between stimuli. Additionally, I do not have experience with this type of data analysis so it will definitely be a learning curve. I am confident in my ability to learn, but I am sure it will take a bit to feel confident doing so.

## Methods

### Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size. Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

The original study utilizes a series of analyses to determine whether decision speed impacts moral character perception.

-   **Decision on Moral Character:** A significant main effect of decision type (F(1, 117) = 541.52, p \< .001) revealed that Justin, who decided quickly (M = 6.44, SE = .08), was perceived differently from Nate (M = 2.15, SE = .12). Moral decision also influenced character evaluation (F(1, 117) = 127.07, p \< .001), with returning the wallet seen as morally better.

-   **Decision Speed and Emotional Impulsivity:** Justin was viewed as less emotionally impulsive (M = 2.40, SE = .11) than Nate (M = 3.79, SE = .12), (F(1, 117) = 95.26, p \< .001), but this did not affect moral evaluations (t \< 1).

-   **Decision Speed and Moral Evaluation Polarization:** The Decision × Speed interaction was significant (F(1, 117) = 127.07, p \< .001), with quick immoral decisions leading to more negative evaluations (t(54) = 8.28, p \< .001) and quick moral decisions to more positive evaluations (t(63) = 7.71, p \< .001).

-   **Certainty as a Mediator:** Quick decisions were associated with higher certainty (F(1, 117) = 706.6, p \< .001). Certainty mediated the relationship between decision speed and moral evaluation, with greater certainty explaining more negative evaluations for immoral decisions and more positive evaluations for moral ones.

Power analyses will be employed to determine the sample sizes needed to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power for detecting effect sizes from the original study.

While the original study had 119 participants in experiment 1, ours will likely have less for a number of reasons.

-   **Funding:** Due to limited funding, and the importance of fairly compensating participants, we will have a smaller sample size than the original study.

-   **Dropout Rate:** To account for participants potentially not completing the study, we will aim to start with a larger sample size.

-   **Quality of Data:** To ensure we have enough good quality data, again we will aim to start with a larger sample size. If participants fail attention checks we can discard their data while still having enough good quality data.

-   **Participant Recruitment**: The availability of the target population may influence our recruitment ability, potentially impacting our planned sample size.

### Planned Sample

Based on the original studies findings, we plan to have a sample size of approximately **FILL IN** participants. This sample size will take into account fair compensation, dropout rate, and ensuring high quality data. Our study will implement a termination rule based on the time constraints. As we have just over a month to complete this study, if we do not meet our ideal sample size by **ADD DATE**, we will still stop recruitment to ensure adequate time for data analysis.

The sampling frame will consist of individuals in the participant pool on the website Prolific. As in line with the original study, participants will mostly be students in higher education, however it will not be specific to region. The original study did not state any demographic information, however we will collect data such as age and gender. No preselection rules will apply.

### Materials

Participants in this study were presented with a story focusing on two men, as outlined in the original article. The story was structured as follows.

Participants read about both Justin and Nate, two men who each independently came upon two separate cash-filled wallets in the parking lot of a local grocery store. Justin "was able to decide quickly" what to do, while Nate "was only able to decide after long and careful deliberation." Participants assigned to the moral condition learned that both men "did not steal the money but instead left the wallet with customer service." Those in the immoral condition learned that both men "pocketed the money and drove off."

Immediately following the description of Justin and Nate’s actions, participants answered a series of questions related to the men’s moral character evaluation. These questions were rated on a 1-7 scale.

-   **Quickness**:

    -   "As a manipulation check, participants indicated how quickly (vs. slowly) the decision was made"

-   **Moral Character Evaluation**:

    -   "The three moral evaluation items had participants assess the agents’ underlying moral principles and standards... by asking whether the agent: “has entirely good (vs. entirely bad) moral principles,” “has good (vs. bad) moral standards,” and “deep down has the moral principles and knowledge to do the right thing"."

-   **Certainty**:

    -   "Participants indicated “how conflicted she felt when making her decision” (reverse-scored), “how many reservations she had” (reverse-scored), whether the target “was quite certain in her decision” (vs. had considerable reservations), and “how far she was from choosing the alternate course of action"."

-   **Emotional impulsivity**:

    -   "Participants indicated to what extent the person remained “calm and emotionally contained” (reverse-scored) and “became upset and acted without thinking.""

### Procedure

Participants will read about two men, Justin and Nate, who come upon separate cash-filled wallets in a grocery store parking lot. Justin “was able to decide quickly” what to do, while Nate “was only able to decide after long and careful deliberation.”

Participants read stories from both conditions:

1.  Moral decision: Justin and Nate both decide not to steal the money and return the wallets.
2.  Immoral decision: Justin and Nate both decide to keep the money and drive off.

Participants will be asked to rate how quickly each decision was made and evaluate the moral character, certainty, and impulsivity of both Justin and Nate. Randomization will be used to control for order effects.

-   **Note**:

    -   This procedure was followed **precisely** as outlined in the original article without deviations.

After reading the story, they were presented with the questions which they ranked on a scale from 1-7 regarding their feelings toward the men's decisions. An attention check was also added to the end of the questions, to ensure that participants were present in the study.

### Analysis Plan

To begin analysis, we cleaned the data by excluding participants with missing data. If participants failed the manipulation check, their data would also be excluded.

The key analysis of interest is the effect of decision speed and decision type on moral character evaluation. This analysis will help to confirm if the original findings (that moral judgments are influenced by both the speed of the decision and the choice) are replicable in our sample. As in the original study, we will include perceived certainty as a covariate, which was shown to mediate the relationship between decision speed and moral judgment.

### Design Overview

-   Two factors were manipulated: decision type and decision speed.

-   Four measures were taken: quickness, moral character evaluation, certainty, emotional impulsivity.

-   It was a within subjects design.

-   Measures were not repeated.

-   There was no mention of steps taken to reduce demand characteristics.

-   Participants with previous traumatic exposure to a relevant situation or personal ties may have strong feelings regarding moral evaluation, which may serve as a confounding variable.

### Differences from Original Study

The main difference from the original study is that we performed one experiment rather than two. Specifically, we replicated experiment 1.

Our participant pool is also different. The original paper included mainly undergraduate students at UC Berkeley, as well as members from the surrounding community. As we are not a part of that institution, our participants are not from that community. We conducted our study entirely online, unlike the original study, which did not specify whether participants were tested in a lab or online. Using Prolific, we did not impose any regional restrictions, which meant we couldn’t control the exact environment in which participants completed the study. Lastly, we added an attention check at the end of the questions which the original study did not have. This was to ensure that participants were not just clicking through, and to help minimize bots. These differences are not expected to make a difference in obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan

Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.

## Results

### Data preparation

To prepare the dataset for analysis, we will begin by thoroughly cleaning the data. Entries with missing values will be removed to maintain data integrity. Additionally, any responses that did not pass attention checks will be excluded to ensure high data quality. Outliers will be identified and assessed; if they prove to be problematic they will also be removed. After these steps, we will ensure the dataset is correctly formatted, providing a solid foundation for the analysis phase.

### Confirmatory analysis

A two-way ANOVA was conducted to examine the main effects of decision type (whether participants decided to return or keep the wallet) and decision speed (quick or slow) on the moral character evaluation. This analysis allowed us to assess how these factors independently influenced moral judgments.

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt. None of these need to be long.
