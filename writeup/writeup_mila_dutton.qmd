## Introduction

This paper examines how the speed in making moral decisions can shape how others view as, as well as how we assess our own actions. This is a topic that has always been fascinating to me, especially as a psychology undergrad major, with experience researching cognition. The intersection between decision making and moral cognition touches on the core psychological questions regarding ethics, thought process, and social environments.

The experiment will follow the structure of the original study by having participants read stories regarding making moral decisions at varying speeds. In experiment 1, two men find separate wallets in a parking lot. One man immediately decides what to do with the wallet while the other decides after a "long and careful deliberation". In the moral condition, both men turn the wallet in, and in the immoral decision both men keep the wallet. Participants are then given questionnaires in which they rank the following sets: quickness, moral character evaluation, certainty, and emotional impulsivity. Experiment 2 follows a similar structure but is between subjects. The story depicts a single mother who is struggling to afford her son. Her boss offers to adopt her son and in return will triple her salary. She is described as either taking 3 seconds or 3 days to come to a decision, and her decision was independently varied. Participants will then use the same scales as well as two additional scales in which they rank her motives to "get more money" and "protect her child". In our study, we only replicated experiment 1. A two way ANOVA test was run to assess decision speed and type of decision, and a regression analysis was run to further explore relationships between certainty and morality.

A potential challenge is that I do not have experience with this type of data analysis so it will definitely be a learning curve. I am confident in my ability to learn, but I am sure it will take a bit to feel confident doing so.

## Methods

### Power Analysis

The original study utilizes a series of analyses to determine whether decision speed impacts moral character perception.

-   **Decision on Moral Character:** A significant main effect of decision type (F(1, 117) = 541.52, p \< .001) revealed that Justin, who decided quickly (M = 6.44, SE = .08), was perceived differently from Nate (M = 2.15, SE = .12). Moral decision also influenced character evaluation (F(1, 117) = 127.07, p \< .001), with returning the wallet seen as morally better.

-   **Decision Speed and Emotional Impulsivity:** Justin was viewed as less emotionally impulsive (M = 2.40, SE = .11) than Nate (M = 3.79, SE = .12), (F(1, 117) = 95.26, p \< .001), but this did not affect moral evaluations (t \< 1).

-   **Decision Speed and Moral Evaluation Polarization:** The Decision × Speed interaction was significant (F(1, 117) = 127.07, p \< .001), with quick immoral decisions leading to more negative evaluations (t(54) = 8.28, p \< .001) and quick moral decisions to more positive evaluations (t(63) = 7.71, p \< .001).

-   **Certainty as a Mediator:** Quick decisions were associated with higher certainty (F(1, 117) = 706.6, p \< .001). Certainty mediated the relationship between decision speed and moral evaluation, with greater certainty explaining more negative evaluations for immoral decisions and more positive evaluations for moral ones.

We planned to perform power analyses to determine the sample sizes needed to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power for detecting effect sizes from the original study. However, the original study did not give difference between means, or error bars. For that reason, we were unable to calculate effect size and determine sample size through that methodology. The original study had 119 participants, so we followed the standard practice of doing 2.5 times the original sample, leaving us with a sample size of 298.

### Planned Sample

Based on the original studies findings, we plan to have a sample size of approximately 298 participants. This is 2.5 times the original sample size. Our study will implement a termination rule based on the time constraints. As we have just over a month to complete this study, if we do not meet our ideal sample size by **ADD DATE**, we will still stop recruitment to ensure adequate time for data analysis.

The sampling frame will consist of individuals in the participant pool on the website Prolific. No preselection rules applied.

### Materials

Participants in this study were presented with a story focusing on two men, as outlined in the original article. Through reaching out to the original researchers, we were able to get access to their exact materials. The story was structured as follows.

"Justin and Nate were walking to separate cars in the parking lot of Andronico’s, a local grocery store, when they each spotted a different lost wallet next to their cars. Upon picking up the wallet and looking inside, each found several hundred dollars in cash. Each man considered whether he should return the wallet and money to the Customer Service desk at Andronico’s, or pocket the money and drive away.

Moral Condition

Justin saw his decision as an easy one and was able to decide quickly. He did not steal the money and instead left the wallet with Customer Service.

In contrast, Nate saw his decision as difficult and was only able to decide after long and careful deliberation. After several minutes of thinking in his car, he too decided not to steal the money and instead left the wallet with Customer Service.

Immoral Condition

Justin saw his decision as an easy one and was able to decide quickly. He pocketed the money and drove off.

In contrast, Nate saw his decision as difficult and was only able to decide after long and careful deliberation. After several minutes of thinking in his car, he too decided to pocket the money and drive off."

Immediately following the description of Justin and Nate’s actions, participants answered a series of questions related to the men’s moral character evaluation. These questions were rated on a 1-7 scale. These questions were also taken directly from the original research.

-   **Quickness**:

    -   Did \[Character\] make his decision quickly or slowly? (1 = particularly slowly, 7 = particularly quickly)

-   **Moral Character Evaluation**:

    -   Regardless of \[Character\]'s decision, does it sound like \[Character\] has underlying moral principles that are good, bad, or somewhere in between? (1 = completely bad, 4 = mixed, 7 = completely good)
    -   Regardless of \[Character\]'s decision, do you think Justin has moral standards that are good, bad, or somewhere in between? (1 = completely bad, 4 = mixed, 7 = completely good)
    -   Regardless of \[Character\]'s decision, do you think Justin possesses the moral knowledge and principles necessary to do ‘the right thing’? (1 = not at all, 4 = somewhat, 7 = completely)

-   **Certainty**:

    -   Would you say \[Character\] was quite certain in his decision, or did \[Character\] have hesitations about his or her decision? (1 = completely certain, 7 = considerable hesitations)
    -   How close do you think \[Character\] was to choosing the alternate course of action? (1 = very close to, 7 = not close at all)
    -   How conflicted do you think \[Character\] felt in making the decision? (1 = very conflicted, 7 = not at all conflicted)
    -   Based on the information provided, do you think \[Character\] had many reservations about the decision? (1 = none at all, 7 = a whole lot)

-   **Emotional impulsivity**:

    -   Do you think Justin (or Nate) was calm and emotionally contained while making the decision? (1 = not at all, 7 = entirely so)
    -   To what extent do you think Justin (or Nate) became upset and acted without thinking? (1 = not at all, 7 = entirely so)

### Procedure

Participants read about two men, Justin and Nate, who come upon separate cash-filled wallets in a grocery store parking lot. Justin “was able to decide quickly” what to do, while Nate “was only able to decide after long and careful deliberation.”

Participants read stories from one of the following conditions:

1.  Moral decision: Justin and Nate both decide not to steal the money and return the wallets.
2.  Immoral decision: Justin and Nate both decide to keep the money and drive off.

Participants were asked to rate how quickly each decision was made and evaluate the moral character, certainty, and impulsivity of both Justin and Nate.

-   **Note**:

    -   This procedure was followed **precisely** as outlined in the original article without deviations.

After reading the story, they were presented with the questions which they ranked on a scale from 1-7 regarding their feelings toward the men's decisions. An attention check was also added to the end of the questions, to ensure that participants were present in the study.

### Analysis Plan

To begin analysis, we cleaned the data by excluding participants with missing data. If participants failed the manipulation check, their data would also be excluded.

The key analysis of interest is the effect of decision speed and decision type on moral character evaluation. This analysis will help to confirm if the original findings (that moral judgments are influenced by both the speed of the decision and the choice) are replicable in our sample. As in the original study, we will include perceived certainty as a covariate, which was shown to mediate the relationship between decision speed and moral judgment.

### Design Overview

-   Two factors were manipulated: decision type and decision speed.

-   Four measures were taken: quickness, moral character evaluation, certainty, emotional impulsivity.

-   It was a within subjects design.

-   Measures were not repeated.

-   There was no mention of steps taken to reduce demand characteristics.

-   Participants with previous traumatic exposure to a relevant situation or personal ties may have strong feelings regarding moral evaluation, which may serve as a confounding variable.

### Differences from Original Study

The main difference from the original study is that we performed one experiment rather than two. Specifically, we replicated experiment 1.

Our participant pool was also different. The original paper included mainly undergraduate students at UC Berkeley, as well as members from the surrounding community. As we are not a part of that institution, our participants are not from that community. We conducted our study entirely online, unlike the original study, which did not specify whether participants were tested in a lab or online. Using JsPsych, we did not impose any regional restrictions, which meant we couldn’t control the exact environment in which participants completed the study. Lastly, we added an attention check at the end of the questions which the original study did not have. This was to ensure that participants were not just clicking through, and to help minimize bots. These differences are not expected to make a difference in obtaining the effect.

## Results

### Data preparation

To prepare the dataset for analysis, we began by thoroughly cleaning the data. Entries with missing values were removed to maintain data integrity. Additionally, any responses that did not pass attention checks were excluded to ensure high data quality. Outliers were identified and assessed; if they proved to be problematic they were also removed. After these steps, we ensured the dataset was correctly formatted, providing a solid foundation for the analysis phase.

```

### Confirmatory analysis

A two-way ANOVA was conducted to examine the main effects of decision type (whether participants decided to return or keep the wallet) and decision speed (quick or slow) on the moral character evaluation. This analysis allowed us to assess how these factors independently influenced moral judgments.

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt. None of these need to be long.
