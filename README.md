# Replication of "How Quick Decisions Illuminate Moral Character" by Critcher et al. (2013)

This repository contains a replication of Experiment 1 from *"How Quick Decisions Illuminate Moral Character"*. This study investigates how the speed of decision-making influences perceptions of moral character. Participants read scenarios involving characters making moral or immoral decisions either quickly or slowly. They then evaluate these characters based on attributes like moral principles, certainty, impulsiveness, and quickness. This replication examines how morality and decision speed interact to shape judgments of character.

## File Naming Conventions

To maintain clarity and reproducibility, this repository follows standardized file naming conventions:

### Raw Data Files

- Individual participant data files are stored in the `data/` folder with the `.csv` extension.
- Each file is named using a unique identifier 

### Cleaned Data

- `combined_data.csv`: The final cleaned dataset used for all analyses.

### Scripts

- `data_processing.R`: An R script that combines, cleans, and processes raw data into a final dataset.


## Manuscripts

This replication focuses on Experiment 1 from Critcher et al. (2013), providing insights into the interaction between morality and decision-making speed in shaping perceptions of character. Using the cleaned dataset and accompanying scripts, you can reproduce figures, tables, and statistical models included in the analysis.
