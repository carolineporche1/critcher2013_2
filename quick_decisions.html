Your responses will help us understand how people perceive decision-making in different moral scenarios.</p>

                       <p class="story-text">First, you will be presented with a brief story describing the actions of the two characters.</p>
                       <p class="story-text">After reading the story, you will be asked a series of questions regarding each character’s decisions and your impressions of their behavior. The story will remain visible on the screen as you answer the questions to help you recall details.</p>
                       <p class="story-text">Each question will use a scale from 1 to 7. Please answer each question based on your personal perception of each character.</p>
                       <p class="story-text">Your responses are anonymous and will only be used for research purposes. Please try to respond as accurately and honestly as possible.</p>
